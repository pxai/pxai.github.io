<p>You may need this to list all the tables from an Oracle tablespace with the record or row count
The list of tables comes from a SQL, but the rest must be done with PL/SQL</p
<pre class="brush: js">
DECLARE 
    val NUMBER;
BEGIN
    FOR I IN (select table_name from all_tables where owner = 'TABLESPACE') 
    LOOP

        EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'SELECT count(*) FROM  TABLESPACE.' || i.table_name  INTO val;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(i.table_name || ' ==> ' || val );

    END LOOP;
END;
</pre>

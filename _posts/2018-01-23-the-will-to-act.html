    Nowadays, developers and any IT related people are privileged with insane employment rates. And at the same time, there are so many technologies emerging and continuously evolving that specialized roles are required in every corner: IoT, blockchain, machine learning, you name it. We can consider ourselves extra-lucky because we are able to choose and build a specific career in whatever area we like. Therefore it seems quite easy to find a job anytime, anywhere. But, that “any” is the word that it should ring a bell in your brain. Is it “any” good enough? You get a job, you are part of a company, you have your place, your multiple screens and some extra goodies. There is also a hideous feeling growing in your guts: this is comfortable, easy and even if you work on IT environment, you may end up stuck in a rut behind your desk, trapped in a fancy crystal cage or worse, inside your own cubicle.

    Out there, you could have a chance to work on many other interesting projects, for different companies, knowing and learning from different like-minded mates. And whats more, you could change and move on diverse projects, surfing the waves of bleeding edge technologies from anywhere, and this time, "any" is for good. Remote positions are the right answer to be truly on the pathway to an evolving and ever-growing career. One thing is for sure: you will never waste your time in boring daily commuting.

        But how could you join the ranks of the <a href="https://www.toptal.com/web" title="Here are some of them">top-notch web engineers</a>? I know, on your way you’ve met very smart people with natural intuition and amazing technical skills, and you don’t feel worthy of them. Relax! Probably you already completed a degree wich difficulty was above the average, and you are, by far, playing a very specialized role, dealing with a plethora of languages and solving complex tasks. You write commands on a console without hesitation and you know how to build and deliver stuff. So what? Are you up for a leap? Why don’t you give it a try? Because as a young Bilbo Baggins, maybe you prefer to stay in the same place, where you feel comfortable and secure, and where everything is just fine as it is. The change seems like a crazy idea, but it’s not because your lack of skills; you’ve got them! This is a matter of will.

       Batman Begins is one of my all-time favorite films. It’s not a movie about a superhero, it tells the story of Bruce Wayne, and all Nolan’s trilogy is about a guy behind the mask.What it is shown here is all the process of building the Batman as a character, in a wide sense of the term, and surprisingly the soon-to-be villain becomes some kind of mean, ruthless stepfather and mentor. There is an intense training scene on the ice of a glacier where they clash their swords while the mentor teases Mr. Wayne:
   </p>
    <p>

    <div>"Your parents' death was not your fault. It was your father’s."</div>
    <div>(Bruce Wayne looked surprised and then he started a raging attack. The mentor stopped him with ease, and kept on talking)</div>
        <div>"Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act."</div>
            <div>"The man had a gun!"</div>
                <div>"Would that stop you?"</div>
                    <div>"I've had training. "</div>
                        <div>"Your training is nothing! Will is everything! "</div>
                            <div> (Then Bruce understood).</div>
                                <div>"The will to act" added the mentor.</div>

    </p>

    The movie has many other great moments that explain why Bruce Wayne becomes the Batman, but the will to act is my favorite line and the idea with I agree the most. But don’t get me wrong. After some years of teaching and involved as we are in the life-long learning, I am a strong believer in the “training”. But will is what sustains everything else. Even for that continuous training, to keep up with changes, you need a good amount of it.

    Will is what it takes to start with that first step. It’s a leap of faith in yourself, fueled and driven by your own willpower.

    There is nothing to lose and much to win, so why not?  Anytime, you could go back to the comfort in your hobbit-hole in the Shire. Let me tell you one last thing: there are others, in some cases lesser-skilled than you already on that quest. What are you waiting for?

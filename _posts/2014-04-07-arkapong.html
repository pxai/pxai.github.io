This a classic pong-like game that takes some ideas from Arkanoid. Basically
two paddles try to hit the ball until one of them fails but, from time to time
the rules can change if special bricks are touched.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Red:</b> invert ball direction</li>
<li><b>White:</b> triple ball</li>
<li><b>Yellow:</b> smaller paddles</li>
<li><b>Blue:</b> bigger paddles</li>
<li><b>Green:</b> speed up ball</li>
<li><b>Orange:</b> change ball up-down direction</li>
<li><b>Brown:</b> minimize paddles</li>
<li><b>Pink:</b> move paddles randomly</li>
</ul>

For one or two players, much more fun if you play it against someone else,
the game is controlled with your fingers. You can set your preferred ball speed using
the preferences screen.</p>
<p>There is another <a href="http://www.arkapong.com">Arkapong out there</a>, not released yet but It looks very interesting. It's a similar concept but this one is more based on Arkanoid</p>

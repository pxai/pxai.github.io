When Node.JS server side engine came into play along with some other ideas like noSQL databases , javascript language definitely got my attention. These are technologies that turned inside out the way we can develop applications after years and years of php, jsp, aspx and the like querying data through SQL. Changes also came to the client side of the web since AJAX started playing a crucial role in massive apps such as gmail. After the browser wars, javascript seemed to be in an abandoned position in favor of other animated horrors made with flash. But fortunately, now there is a clear rebirth of this language with a plethora of frameworks to develop single page applications and an ever growing helper libraries covering all kind of tasks you can think of. If something exists for other languages you can certainly take for granted that some guy  has a github hosted and forked project providing the same functionality. Ant/Maven and Grunt for example.
</p>
<p>It is also remarkable that this is a community that does not need any well-known MegaCorportarion supporting them. Javascript has increasingly tiptoed to the exclusive group of the most required language on its own right. From support libraries like jquery to MVC frameworks such as Backbone o Angular, client side web has become so important that the classic web developer profile is now split between back-end and front-end developers; and mastering both sides of the web is becoming more and more difficult every day. Anybody who thinks that javascript was but a toy should be ready to rediscover this rich and active ecosystem. And let me whisper you a secret: forget Java or any other interpreted languages out there, relevant or not. Javascript is everywhere, because wherever a web browser is, a JS intepreter must be present no matter if it is an iPhone or your latest Ubuntu box. And anyway, if needed  Node is available for many platforms.
</p>
<p>But let's get down to business. I guess that you are reading this on a browser. Good! You are ready to start right away. Open the javascript console and you will be able to write and try code. Your best options are:
</p><ul>
<li>
<b>Firexox:</b> the built-in web console or using the Firebug add-on, where you can write multiline code just pressing the up arrow on the right of the console. Remember the old days when you only have a console to see the errors? Now you can enter commands and even Tab to get code completion and proposals.
</li><li><b>Chrome</b> has also a built-in developer tool. Go to menu or press Ctrl-Shift-J. If you need to write multiple lines of code just press Shift-Enter. Then press just Enter to run.
</li><li><b><a href=”https://jsfiddle.net” title=”jsfiddle site”>JsFiddle</a></b> or <b><a href=”http://jsbin.com” title=”jsbin site”>JsBin</a></b> website. If you want yo use your browser screen directly this kind of website is the rightful choice. It allows you to include the most popular frameworks to code around.
</li><li><b>Explorer</b>, yes can you believe that? For those who lived through the nineties it is unbelievable this new attitude. Remember when you wanted to see the source code and notepad was opened? Now Explorer comes with some developer tools. It still sucks big time anyway.
</li></ul>
<p>There are other choices like Jetbrains Webstorm of course, but if you want to start quickly and just to learn or rediscover this language, stick to your favorite browser. Javascript seems simple, but when things get complex... hold tight because this could turn into a white-knuckle ride in the web roller coaster.
